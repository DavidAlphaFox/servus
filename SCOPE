When running `servus -p $PORT --project-root $PATH`

Then I should be able to `curl` any file that lives under $PATH and get its
contents out.


Goals:
DONE - Start a HTTP Server
DONE - Respond to Clients
DONE - Return the file contents to the client
DONE - Only respond to GETs

---

NOTES

1. We need some promise that never finished to keep the server running

2. We need to talk at a very low level to get the basics up and running
  (Unix Internet Socket)

3.
